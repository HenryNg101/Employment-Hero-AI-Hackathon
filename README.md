# 🚀 Employment Hero Copilot — Multi-Agent AI for the Future of Work

### What’s this?

Not just a chatbot. This is a **multi-agent Copilot** built for Employment Hero, designed to transform the way employees and HR teams interact with knowledge, policies, and documentation.

Think of it as your own **team of specialists** packed into one interface — always available, always consistent, and always learning.

### 🌟 The Problem

Employees today face two big pains:

* **Endless Questions & Policy Confusion**: HR teams spend countless hours answering repetitive “what’s our leave policy?” type questions.
* **Messy Documentation & Domain Knowledge**: New hires are often lost in technical docs or need months to get up to speed in niche domains.

Large organizations have it even harder — more people, more complexity, more noise.

---

### 💡 The Solution

**Employment Hero Copilot** brings together a team of **AI agents**, each specializing in a different task:

* **Policy Agent** 📝 → Answers HR policy, leave, perks, and compliance questions instantly.
* **Domain Knowledge Agent** 📘 → Helps new hires ramp up on industry/domain knowledge faster.
* **Documentation Agent** 📂 → Digests messy technical docs/codebases, explains in plain English, and even generates missing documentation.
* *(Future extensions: HR Insights, Learning & Development recommendations, performance review support)*

All accessed through a single chat interface. No hunting, no waiting, no confusion.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack (Prototype)

* **Frontend** → Next.js + Typescript (chat interface, file upload)
* **Backend** → FastAPI (Python)
* **AI/LLM** → Ollama + sentence-transformers for semantic chunking
* **Vector Database** → ChromaDB for knowledge storage & retrieval
* **Auth** → Amplify (authentication)

The demo shows how the Copilot learns from uploaded docs (via semantic chunking + RAG) and improves responses instantly.

### 🎯 Why It Matters

* **Innovation** → Multi-agent approach that goes beyond a single chatbot.
* **Impact** → Reduces HR workload, accelerates onboarding, scales knowledge.
* **AI Proficiency** → Thoughtful use of RAG, chunking, embeddings, and vector DB.
* **User Value** → Employees get answers in seconds, HR saves hours daily.
* **Execution** → A bold but simple vision: *a whole HR team in your pocket.*

### 🤝 The Vision

Today it’s a prototype. Tomorrow, it’s a platform where multiple AI specialists collaborate behind the scenes to support every employee — from policy to payroll to professional growth.

Because why settle for one assistant, when you can have a **team of them working for you 24/7?** 😉
